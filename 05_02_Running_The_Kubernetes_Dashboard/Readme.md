### Run the Kubernetes Dashboard in minikube
The Kubernetes Dashboard is a simple, web user interface for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

One of the common asks in the container world is for the need for a ui to visualize what is going on with clusters. It was one of the most requested features of Docker when it first started, and companies like StackEngine, the one I worked at, or Rancher, were the way devops engineers would use to manage clusters.

Kubernetes learned from this lesson early on, and created the Kubernetes Dashboard for this purpose, and it allows you to monitor and view clusters from an operational perspective. 

The dashboard comes pre enabled as an addon. To start up the dashboard type `minikube dashboard` in your command prompt.

This will bring up the dashboard in your browser.
